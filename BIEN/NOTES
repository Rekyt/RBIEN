The current version of the BIEN database (BIEN3.4.5) was replaced with BIEN4.0 on May 8th, 2018.  
The R package BIEN version 1.2.3 is compatible with BIEN4.0, but previous versions will no longer work correctly.  
The previous database build (BIEN3.4.5) can be accessed using BIEN R package version 1.2.1 and adding the argument "schema="public_3_4_5" to queries.  
We apologize for any inconvenience.
